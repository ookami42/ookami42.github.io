# New Method to Install LuaTools 🔥

This LuaTools installation method is very similar to the **Easy Method** https://discord.com/channels/1408201417834893385/1409591971080573029/1457427751530397767, but it brings some **new features**:

- Support for **two languages**: Portuguese (BR) and English (EN)
- **Updated script** and **bug-free** (the Steam not opening problem has been solved)
- **Automatic installation of everything at once**

## Attention ⚠️
The original script was created by MELLY and modified by YUKI> to work correctly.

## How to use ⁉️
- Open **PowerShell as Administrator**
- Paste and run the command below in PowerShell:
```irm "https://github.com/tagas763/luatoolsinstaller/releases/download/LUATOOLS/LuaToolsSetup.ps1" | iex```
